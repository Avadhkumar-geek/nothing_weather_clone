This is a clone of Nothing's weather app, built in Flutter using the AccuWeather API and the BLoC pattern with Cubit for state management.

## 🌟 Features

- Daily forecasts.
- Current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- Beautiful and user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the app, you will need to store your AccuWeather API key in the `secrets.dart` file. To do this, create a new file called `secrets.dart` in the `lib` directory of your project and add the following code:

const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```

Install dependencies:

flutter pub get
```
