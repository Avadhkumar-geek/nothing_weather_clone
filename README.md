This is a clone of Nothing's weather app, built in Flutter using the AccuWeather API and the BLoC pattern with Cubit for state management.

## Features

- Real-time weather data for any location in the world.
- Daily forecasts.
- Current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- Beautiful and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

To use the app, you will need to store your AccuWeather API key in the `secrets.dart` file. To do this, create a new file called `secrets.dart` in the `lib` directory of your project and add the following code:

```dart
const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```

Install dependencies:

```bash 
flutter pub get
```

Run the app:

```
